# Welcome

This is the website hosting all of the Glimesh API documentation.  If you have any questions let us know in our [Discord](https://glimesh.tv/s/discord)!

The API docs are hosted [here](https://glimesh.github.io/api-docs/).

## Structure

This repo is divided into topics (auth, chat, etc.). Each topic has several tutorial pages. Most of the examples are generic and not specific to any programming language. However, some pages do contain code samples.
Some pages will help you understand the API while others help you build something (chatbot/follow alerts).

This documentation is a work in progress. We will do our best to keep this updated!
