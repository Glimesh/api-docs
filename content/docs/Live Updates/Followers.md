# Follower Alerts

This is a tutorial for follow alerts. This guide assumes you have a [client ID](https://glimesh.tv/users/settings/applications) or an access token from a user. You should also have a websocket connection open from [this](/api-docs/docs/chat/websockets/) tutorial. Having basic GraphQL knowledge would also be helpful.
> New to GraphQL? This tutorial explains the basics. https://graphql.org/learn/schema/

## Building the Subscription

Follow alerts are made of a standard subscription. The streamer ID of the channel that you want to have alerts for is required. A streamer ID is equal to the user ID. You can acquire the ID with the below query.

```graphql
query {
  user(username:"Mytho") {
    id
  }
}
```
> Make sure to replace Mytho with the channel name.

We will insert this ID into the below subscription. You must subscribe to this event through a websocket connection. Glimesh will notify us whenever a user follows the channel.

```graphql
subscription {
  followers(streamerId:6) {
    hasLiveNotifications,
    id,
    insertedAt,
    streamer {
      username
    },
    updatedAt,
    user {
      username
    }
  }
}
```

The above subscription shows all of the properties we can receive. This excludes nested properties. This information will be sent to us whenever the specified channel gets a new follower.

## Follower Query

A subscription is the standard way to get follower alerts. However, this is not the only method to get the followers of a channel. We can make a query to get the followers of a channel as well as the followers of a user. You will need the ID of the streamer or of the user. The following query will return the followers of a streamer.

> streamerId is the **user** ID, not the channel ID.

> Followers are paginated, see our guide on that [here](/api-docs/docs/api/pagination)

```GraphQL
query {
  followers(streamerId: 6) {
    edges {
      node {
        hasLiveNotifications
        id
        insertedAt
        streamer {
          username
        }
        updatedAt
        user {
          username
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
We requested the same properties as before. Glimesh will send us a JSON format response.
```JS
{
  "data": {
    "followers": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "hasLiveNotifications": false,
            "id": "613",
            "insertedAt": "2020-08-09T15:14:21",
            "streamer": {
              "username": "Mytho"
            },
            "updatedAt": "2020-08-09T15:14:21",
            "user": {
              "username": "Mytho"
            }
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "hasLiveNotifications": false,
            "id": "629",
            "insertedAt": "2020-08-09T16:35:55",
            "streamer": {
              "username": "Mytho"
            },
            "updatedAt": "2020-08-09T16:35:55",
            "user": {
              "username": "TheCat"
            }
          }
        },
      and so on...
```

We can also request who a user is following. The query is nearly identical. The only thing we change is the parameter. Replace `streamerId` with `userId`.

```graphql
query {
  followers(userId: 6) {
    edges {
      node {
        hasLiveNotifications
        id
        insertedAt
        streamer {
          username
        }
        updatedAt
        user {
          username
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
